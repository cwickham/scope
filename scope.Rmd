title: Scope for functions in global env

```{r}
devtools::load_all()
```

Define `f_local()` in the global environment:
```{r}
f_local <- function(x){
  y <<- x
}
```

Set a value for `y`, also in the global environment:
```{r}
y <- 0
```

Now, since the parent environment of `f_local()` is the global environment, calling `f_local()` changes the value of `y`:
```{r}
f_local(5)
y
```

Compare this to `f_package()`.  Since the environment of the function `f_package()` is the package namespace, it finds the definition of `y` in `f_package.R`, not the `y` in the global environment, and `y` doesn't appear changed:
```{r}
f_package(10)
y
```

Although it actually changed this other `y`:
```{r}
scope::y
```
